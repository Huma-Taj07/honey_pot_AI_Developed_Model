# Honeypot AI Trained Model for Ransomware Detection

## Description
This project focuses on developing an intelligent Honeypot system that uses AI and machine learning techniques to detect and analyze ransomware behavior. By simulating a real-world environment, the system attracts ransomware, records suspicious activities, and trains an AI model to identify and prevent ransomware attacks. This approach leverages both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to ensure robust ransomware detection and prediction.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that the following software and libraries are installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (can be installed using `requirements.txt`)
- 


## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the command below:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   
   Change the directory to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name

3. **Install Dependencies**
   
   If you have a `requirements.txt` file, install the required Python libraries using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   
   Start Jupyter Notebook from the command line:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

5. **Open the Notebook**
   
   In the Jupyter Notebook interface that opens in your web browser, navigate to and open the .ipynb file related to the Honeypot AI model.

6. **Run the Cells**
   
   Once the notebook is open, run all the cells by selecting `Cell > Run` All or running the cells individually. This will execute the code in each section of the notebook.

8. **Observe the Output**
   
   The notebook will display the output of each step, including data loading, model training, evaluation, and predictions for ransomware detection.
