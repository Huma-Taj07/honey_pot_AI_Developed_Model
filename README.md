# Honeypot AI Trained Model for Ransomware Detection

## Description
This project focuses on developing an intelligent Honeypot system that uses AI and machine learning techniques to detect and analyze ransomware behavior. By simulating a real-world environment, the system attracts ransomware, records suspicious activities, and trains an AI model to identify and prevent ransomware attacks. This approach leverages both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to ensure robust ransomware detection and prediction.

## Prerequisites
